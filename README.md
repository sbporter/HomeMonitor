# HomeMonitor
This is a personal project I am building to interface with www.devicehub.net .  I am planning to use it to monitor current and historical data for some arduino based climate sensors used in the home and office. I will also use it to control some LED light strips connected to my Wemos D1 Mini Pro, an arduino based wifi board.
